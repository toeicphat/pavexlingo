So maybe we should consider selling a shredded version that would melt easily when cooked. I'm sure we could do that. I'll get in touch with the production manager with that request." },

It reported that the upgrade would be economical only for relatively new trains—that is, those less than five years old. All of ours are at least ten years old. I hope this addresses your questions.

A lot of our stores could benefit from this, but I've decided to conduct a trial run at our store in the Center City Mall. By far, that's our busiest location." },

I had to call them on my phone to come pick up their food. At first, I tried to call on the building intercom, but it's still broken. You're not the first to say that. Last week, a customer called to complain that their food was cold by the time they found it. Maybe we just can't make deliveries there until the landlord fixes the intercom system. I'm going to update the instructions on our mobile app telling customers to meet us at the building's front door. Let's see if that helps." },

Why don't we invite community residents to volunteer to help with building sets, painting, and setting up the stage? We could, but I don't know if we'll be able to use volunteers this year. We'll need approval to start that kind of program. It'll take time. Let's check into that for next year." },

Before the break, we promised to address the decline of shopping downtown. Yes—and it's been the worst at the kind of stores that sell unique items like antiques and jewelry. These items have always been purchased at brick-and-mortar stores but are now being purchased mostly online. So, do those stores have a future? I think they do, especially if we make a point of organizing live community activities downtown, such as concerts or festivals. When people walk around town, they are likely to browse at stores—and make purchases." },

And they're telling their friends, increasing our sales. Yes. The rebate's been great for our company because now more homeowners have an incentive to install solar panels on their properties, since they're rewarded for the electricity their solar panels produce. But our technicians can't keep up with the high demand. You're right. I'm planning to hire more technicians. I've already received some resumes from potential candidates." },

Before we get started with today's episode, I'd like to note that I provided the wrong dates for the Farming Exposition during last week's episode. The start date of the event is March thirty-first, not the twenty-first. I'm sorry about that. OK, let's move on to today's guest. Ms. Junko Adachi is the director at Fertilizer-ONE—a nonprofit organization that provides small farms with low-cost fertilizer. During her time as director, the organization has helped over 1,000 small farms increase their yields!" },

Unfortunately, this has caused some frame alignment issues. We will not be able to install the new bay window you requested for the front room without more extensive work than the budget will cover. Our work is done for today, but we'll need to know how to proceed by tomorrow. I'll be available for the next couple of hours." },

I'll unlock the door after this meeting. But before you start your shift, make sure to try tonight's specials. They're in their usual spot under the heat lamps.

In particular, we'll look at why you may pay more if you shop during times of peak demand. Called surge pricing, this trend first started with computer software that allowed large airlines to track demand and quickly change their ticket prices. That technology is now widely available. You may find that even small businesses charge more when demand is higher. Our guest today is Professor Yun Hang, a leading expert on the topic. Last month he was the featured speaker at the International Economics Summit." },

Since you're auditioning to join the cast of an ongoing show, you should watch some videos of previous episodes so you understand the role. One last note—since you're new to the city, you might be wondering about the best bus route to take. You could take the green line to Orchard, but I'd recommend taking the yellow line to the last stop. It's a longer route, but the last stop is closer to the studio." }

That is a problem. But offering free delivery attracts a lot of business. What else can we do to lower expenses? We could start using bicycle delivery whenever possible. That should help. Good idea.

I'm calling because we'd like to hire you as a consultant for our film. I recently came across the book you wrote on the history of French fashion and found it fascinating. Since you're an expert on French clothing and lifestyle trends of that time, your knowledge would be valuable as we develop costume and set designs. We'd be thrilled to work with you, and we're offering a generous compensation package. I can send you the details—I'll use the e-mail address that you have on your Web site." },

This easy-to-use service will take you to any destination within the service area, like your doctor's office or the library! And we've recently expanded service to Westbrook, so residents can take the shuttle to the soccer stadium." },

Greenchester is home to some rich prehistoric findings. If you've ever wondered what goes into excavating a site, here's your chance to find out. There'll be a special workshop where you can get hands-on experience practicing excavation skills. The workshop will be held on the grounds in front of the historical society building. As for getting here, I recommend that you simply walk over—many streets will be blocked off for the festival, and it will take longer to drive." }

We need to make space to store the lobby furniture. Actually, I know the plan is to replace those tables and chairs. Maybe we should just donate them now rather than putting them in storage. Good idea! I'll do some research to see which organizations accept donations of furniture. I'm sure there are several in the area." },

But it's important that you get plenty of water and stay hydrated in this heat. I brought a big bottle of it with me, so I should be fine." },

I'm Rajesh Varma, and today I'm here with So-Jin Lee, a botanist from Denton University who recently developed a new hybrid flower. Could you tell us more, Professor Lee? Certainly. I developed a new type of rose-it's special because it blooms longer than any other rose. That's interesting. Is it difficult to grow? Not if it's planted under the right conditions. Next month, the rose will be featured at the botanical show downtown. I hope your listeners will come to see it." },

The app provides a platform for uploading our own training videos. And employees could view them on their phones at any time. You know, I've heard that those online programs help employees retain knowledge. But aren't those apps expensive? Actually, the cost is reasonable. And the Web site has some interesting reviews from other businesses that have used the app and found it helpful." },

Wallerston is one of our biggest clients now. I think Amanda would be a great choice. OK. I'm glad we're on the same page. I'll complete the paperwork and send it to the human resources department later today." },

As you know, the city council is proposing the implementation of a road tax. And I want to make sure the public is informed about it. Well, we like to keep our readers in the know, so we have a long list of questions for you. I'll start. What does the city plan to do with this tax revenue, Ms. Haddad? The money will be used to add bicycle lanes citywide, which I'm excited about. Bicycle lanes should reduce traffic and promote health. Some business owners are concerned about losing street parking. Are you worried about that?" },

I've confirmed your plane reservation. Just remember, Vela Air only allows one free piece of carry-on luggage. Otherwise, there'll be an extra charge. OK. Can you forward the plane ticket confirmation, please? I'll e-mail you right now." },

We were going to start those repairs on Monday, but I've been looking at the weather; it's going to rain all weekend. I think we should reschedule. Right. We can't add a protective layer to the asphalt when it's wet. I'll contact the property manager at the shopping center to discuss alternative dates. OK. Just so you know, we've received a few new requests for consultations on our road repair services. I'll try to slot those in for Monday instead." },
    { id: 18359, title: "Questions 59-61", text: "Tasnim, I've been looking at the production process for soaps in our facility, and I think there's room for improvement. Improvements that could decrease our production time? Yes. Consider this: once the soap mixtures are poured into the molds, employees have to carry the batches across the room. I see what you mean. If we reinstalled the drying racks closer to the mixing station, they wouldn't have to walk as far. Exactly. A small change like that can have a big effect on total output. But wouldn't that be expensive? Let me show you the cost projection." },
    { id: 18362, title: "Questions 62-64", text: "I was just looking at the supply request form you submitted for our engineering department. Yes? I think you might've made a mistake.

Yes, unfortunately, my supplier notified me that they're out of stock because of a shortage. I'm sorry, but you'll have to choose a replacement for the lilies. I know my client likes orchids, but I'm guessing those are too expensive. We'll still need a flower that's under five dollars per stem. Well, what about these? They fit within your budget. Those will be perfect." },

You have the paperwork verifying that I replaced my roof last year, right? Buyers look for properties that don't need major repairs. I do have that. And you're right-recent repairs are a factor that add to the value of a property. The historic windows will be a selling point, I think. They're made of handblown glass. All the storefronts in this row of shops have them. They do add character. Now, I need to walk around with my camera to take some photos to file with my paperwork." }

However, because the watch is quite old, we also took it apart to give it a good cleaning. In the future, we suggest bringing it in for basic maintenance once every three years to keep it in good condition. The watch is ready for you at any time.

Some of you have expressed concern that I might ask you to completely overhaul the entire menu. Well, small changes can have surprising results!" },

    { id: 20365, title: "Questions 65-67", text: "Hi. I want to buy a new pillow. I recently started waking up with a stiff neck, so I want something that will help me sleep better. I can assist you with that. The first thing you should consider is the position you sleep in. Do you sleep on your back, your stomach, or your side? On my side. OK. For side sleepers, we recommend the Star Pillow. It's a firm pillow that will give you good support. Sounds great. One question, though. What's inside the pillow? I have an allergy to feathers. This particular model is made with only nonallergenic materials." },
    { id: 20368, title: "Questions 68-70", text: "Welcome to the team. I hear you have a lot of experience designing software. We need some new ideas for our business software package we're developing. Thanks. I also help set up for the sales presentations. I just fixed a problem with the sound equipment in the conference room. By the way, you're in sales, right? Aren't you presenting to a new client next week? Yes, I love sales. But I especially like the step where we're getting a lot of questions from clients. I can address doubts or objections and show them how the software really meets their needs." }

As you can see, there's a light dusting of snow on the ground. Air traffic control is holding us here at the gate while the snowplows clear the runway. It should take just a few minutes, then we'll be cleared for takeoff. I apologize for the delay. And a reminder: please ensure that children remain seated with their seat belts fastened throughout the flight." },

As we know, the housing market has had its ups and downs in recent years. Ms. Taylor is widely known for her ability to correctly predict trends in the real estate market.

    { id: 20486, title: "Questions 86-88", text: "The topic for today's workshop is writing business correspondence. Business correspondence has different guidelines than the informal type of writing you use when writing to a friend. For example, when writing to a friend you might address them by their first name or perhaps include emojis. You know—symbols like smiley faces that are commonly used to express feelings. However, emojis are considered inappropriate in business writing. Also, business correspondence should always include the recipient's title and last name. Remember, we don't want to offend our clients. Now, I will project some slides of informally worded e-mails. In your notebooks, rewrite the e-mails using wording and style appropriate for business correspondence." },

Clementine claims that the Stephion logo, which is round and orange, is too similar to its own. However, a Stephion public relations representative, Friedrich Weber, responded by saying that the two company logos were similar but not similar enough to confuse consumers. Furthermore, Weber maintained that the Stephion design was not problematic because the two companies are in completely different markets. Our in-house legal analyst will join us next." },

We recently installed a new temperature monitoring system. I've noticed that every increase in temperature can be traced to the refrigerator doors being left open for extended periods of time. This is alarming because it compromises the freshness and safety of our food. We all know that customers often take a while to make their selection. I'll be meeting with the management team to discuss ways to address this." },

Due to the high volume of visitors in the summer, as well as limited parking, we encourage everyone to take the city bus to the park.

As you enter the park, brochures are available with maps of all the hiking trails located throughout the park." }
